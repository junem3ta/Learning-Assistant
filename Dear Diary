Dear Diary.
I want to create a new era, solo. Its kind of difficult because I'm all up here alone, 
and I'm afraid because its a lot of responsibility. No culture, friends or family 
supporting this whatsover - just the things I've seen, been through. It's that experience 
that makes me want to do better. 
It's a lot to process, a lot to take on. People are watching, and moreso I, conscious of 
every little aspect about the things I'm doing with my life, and that naturally makes me 
want to look good. It's in my nature to excel, and that naturally makes me want to be good 
in everything that I do. Battles are lost, but a war won irregardless, I'd like to think. 
I have to accept when I'm loosing to realize when the good moments actually come by.
The hardest part is letting go of the life that I was previously used to, and part of me 
wants to let go of all this and go back to it. I'd end up hating myself for it, of course. My credibility
would be reduced to that of an impulsive person with unsorted priorities, and that doesnt
look good either. A part of me also wants to merge this new life with the one I have been about in 
the recent past. There's a lot of conflicting ideologies that would come with that, and 
I've usually found myself get caught up in the middle of all of it in the past. 
I like the quiet that comes with the new normal, the simple moments that come in the most unexpected moments. 
Like reading a good paragraph in a novel I'd previously never get the time to read, 
rearranging my closet, sorting out my clothing preferences. It's quite healthy, and personal improvement 
is always something that makes me feel like my life is actually headed somewhere. I dont know what lies ahead,
but I'm quite sure of the constant things in life and I'm keeping them close.
